			<summary>Why am I seeing this?</summary>
			<p>You are seeing this because the administrator of this website has set up
				<a href="https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis">Anubis</a> to protect the server against the scourge of
				<a href="https://thelibre.news/foss-infrastructure-is-under-attack-by-ai-companies/">AI companies aggressively scraping
					websites</a>. This can and does cause downtime for the websites, which makes their resources inaccessible for everyone.
			</p>
			<p>Anubis is a compromise. Anubis uses a <a href="https://anubis.techaro.lol/docs/design/why-proof-of-work">Proof-of-Work</a>
				scheme in the vein of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash">Hashcash</a>, a proposed proof-of-work scheme for
				reducing email spam. The idea is that at individual scales the additional load is ignorable, but at mass scraper levels it
				adds up and makes scraping much more expensive.</p>
			<p>Ultimately, this is a hack whose real purpose is to give a "good enough" placeholder solution so that more time can be spent
				on fingerprinting and identifying headless browsers (EG: via how they do font rendering) so that the challenge proof of work
				page doesn't need to be presented to users that are much more likely to be legitimate.</p>
			<p>Please note that Anubis requires the use of modern JavaScript features that plugins like <a href="https://jshelter.org/">JShelter</a>
				will disable. Please disable JShelter or other such plugins for this domain.</p></details>
		<noscript><p>Sadly, you must enable JavaScript to get past this challenge. This is required because AI companies have changed the
				social contract around how website hosting works. A no-JS solution is a work-in-progress.</p></noscript>
